The projects in this folder are considered to make the daily work easier in the CAM department. </br>
Some PCB manufacturers use the software called Ucam from Ucamco Company from Gent/Belgium.</br>
This software has possibility to add any scripts which can be run within the Ucam.</br>
Actually I made two working scripts:
- [the drilltime](https://github.com/pszyjaciel/ucam/tree/master/myUcam/UDrillTime)
- [the silk output](https://github.com/pszyjaciel/ucam/tree/master/myUcam/UcamSilk)

Other scripts will follow. Please enjoy it.</br></br>

A new script for sorting of the holes in the drill layer is ready now.</br>
Often the holes are not sorted and have quite different apperture numbers.</br>
To bring the holes in orden one has to click them one by one and change the sizes, then put them on the right place.</br>
This script do it automatical.</br></br>
