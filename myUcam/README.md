The projects in this folder are considered to make the daily work easier in the CAM department.
Some PCB manufacturers use the software called Ucam from Ucamco Company from Gent/Belgium.
This software has possibility to add any scripts which can be run within the Ucam.

Actually I made two working scripts:
- the drilltime
- the silk output

Other scripts will follow. Please enjoy it.

A new script for sorting of the holes in the drill layer is ready now.
Often the holes are not sorted and have quite different apperture numbers.
To bring the holes in orden one has to click them one by one and change the sizes, then put them on the right place.
This script do it automatical.
