Usual two layers have to be exported to 274x format. One is the silk layer itself and the other
is the outline. Both layers need some modyfications. The frame is removed from the silk data,
and fiducials have to be copied to the outline. Finally both layers are rotated and exported.

This script save about 10-15min (or even 30min when outputing 2 silk layers) for every job process.
