
This program is usefull while outputing the gerber data for the silk screen machine. <br />
Usual two layers have to be exported to 274x format. One is the silk layer itself and the other
is the outline. Both layers need some modyfications. <br />
The frame is removed from the silk data, and fiducials have to be copied to the outline. <br />
Finally both layers are rotated and exported. <br />

This script save about 10-15min (or even 30min when outputing 2 silk layers) for every job process. <br /><br />
