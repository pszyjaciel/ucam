This is the project I often use for testing purposes.

When developping a bigger project I use to create small projects, where I can test 
and learn a new functions. This way I belive to be more efficient, as I don't need
to run the final project, which may need some time to strat. This way I also avoid 
some errors, however the can appear in the main code after merging.
